# Jan-Heal
With JanHeal, we aim to target the Health issue in India. Now letâ€™s have a look what we plan to do: Raw Data Collection Camps

Free medical drives will be conducted across the states by the State Government in order to collect data about medical status. This data will be stored in the Aadhar Database with the Aadhar ID . It means that the medical data of every person will be stored in the Aadhar Card of each person.

2) The Database

The Aadhar Health database will now have a medical record of each person. Based on the medical record of each person a Health Score will be calculated frequently based on an algorithm that we have developed in this project. This health score defines the health index of each member.

3) The WEB API

We have built a WEB API to provide this medical record of a member to government certified hospitals and doctors. The medical records can be accessed by the Aadhar Card Number and the OTP/Password. This will help the doctor to go through previous medical records of a person, family medical history, what medicines the patient had been taking. After retrieving data, the doctor can proceed to his treatment accordingly. After the treatment, the doctor will upload details of the treatment, prescriptions, medicines given so that in future, all other doctors can know about this and make sure no medicine is given which has some effect with previously given treatments.

4) Statistical Analysis

Using R, we have analysed the data into linear graphs calculating various figures like, which age group has the lowest health score, which region has low health score, etc. There are some diseases that are limited to a region. We can identify the regions which are affected by particular diseases and the government can further make sure that doctors and medicines for that disease are always available in that regions. Next medicines can be transported from regions where the possibility of the disease is less to where it is needed more. We also get to know about bad habits/addictions in particular regions so that the government can open rehab centres. While collecting data we will also ask if they are interested to donate blood in future or not. In case of need of a specific blood group, we can easily track people and obtain the required blood in case of emergency.

5) Revenue Model

An average health score will be calculated for each state in India and this statistical data will be sold to Insurance companies. This data can also be sold to various medicine manufacturers and private hospitals so that they can ensure medicines and services are adequately available in those regions.

This statistical analysis can further be linked with machine learning to predict the regions which will be needing specific doctors in the future and can predict diseases in particular areas. This can be a breakthrough in the health segment in India and can actually improve the condition of hospitals.
